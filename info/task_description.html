    88 is a magic number.
    If you will open "Ancient human puzzles catalog for modern robots" at the 88th page,
    you will see a puzzle which Nikola hunts a long ago. And it's happen.
    Nikola's uncle have delivered this puzzle from the history expedition in human past.
    Now we will learn Nikola to solve that.
</p>

    The puzzle is looked as four intersected circles with 12 color marbles: 2 red, 2 blue, 2 green, 2 orange and 4 grey.
    Let's look at the picture. The marbles should be placed as it shown on the picture.
    Each hole and color has a number for data representation of a state. Hole numbers you can see on the picture.
    Color numbers: 1 - blue, 2 - green, 3 - red, 4 - orange, 0 - grey.
    So the initial state (or completed) will be represented as the sequence of numbers,
    where an index is a hole number:<br>
    (1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 4, 3, 4).

</p>

<p>
    You can rotate rings by clockwise. Each move is rotating at 90 degrees.
    The rings are numbered and sequence of action should be represented as a list/tuple of numbers from 1 to 4.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a twisted puzzle state as a tuple of numbers.
    You should return it in the initial state with minimal numbers of steps.
    For example, the state from the next picture will be represented as
    (0,2,1,3,2,1,4,0,0,4,0,3) and can be solved by 4 steps "1433" or "4133"cd 88    .

    <strong>Input: </strong> A puzzle state as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The shortest solution as a string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    One more puzzle which will show you how you can use computer to solve various problems.
    This is a combinatorial problem to search the optimal solution with modeling.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    len(state) == 11<br>
    all(0 &le; n &le; 4 for n in state)<br>
    All test cases are solvable.
